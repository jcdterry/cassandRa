Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Chris", "Terry", email = "christerry3@btinternet.com", role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"))
Description: Provides methods to deal with under sampling in ecological bipartite networks from
     Terry and Lewis (2020) Ecology doi:10.1002/ecy.3047 Includes 
     tools to fit a variety of statistical network models and sample coverage estimators to highlight most likely 
     missing links. Also includes simple functions to resample from observed networks to generate confidence 
     intervals for common ecological network metrics.
